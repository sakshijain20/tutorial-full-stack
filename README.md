# tutorial-full-stack

This is my first full-stack application where I have used SpringBoot with the h2 database and Angular 11 for front end.

# Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and you will be able to see the below UI over localhost in the browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
