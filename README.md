# tutorial-full-stack

This is my first full stack application where I have used SpringBoot with h2 database and used Angular 11 for frontend.

# Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and you will be able to see the below UI over localhost in browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
